# ir_receiver_sny

This repository contains code that can be used to receive signals from infra-red remote controls.

The code runs on the Pi Pico (RP2040 chip). The code makes use of the PIO core.

The sny_ir folder contains C/C++ code.

The main.py file contains the MicroPython version, again using the PIO.
