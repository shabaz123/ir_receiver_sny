# ir_receiver_sny

This repository contains code that can be used to receive signals from remote controls.
This includes TV and camera remote controls. Many manufacturers produce remote controls that are compatible with this code.

The code runs on the Pi Pico (RP2040 chip). The code makes use of the PIO core.

The sny_ir folder contains C/C++ code.

The main.py file contains the MicroPython version, again using the PIO.
